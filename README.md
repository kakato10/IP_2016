# Introduction to programming 2016/2017
Well this will be the repository, that will store all materials and tasks related to the "Introduction to programming" 2016 course for Software Enginnering and Informatics at FMI, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski". 

##Are you ready for the long sleepless journey ahead, called programming?

###I definietely hope so, but just in case, get yourself a 'bit' more coffee than usual.

Basically, in this course we're going to cover a lot of interesting topics related to programming. Mostly will look at them in the context of C++. I will do my best to give you a good idea about how things in programming are actually happening. There are going to be a lot of tasks so that you can practice what you've already learned. Hopefully at the end of the course you'll have an enormous boost in your programming skills so that you can start building your dream career as fast as possible.

##"For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match." - Bill Bryson

###PS
Remember, sometimes stupid things might lead to incredible possibilities.
