Tasks
=====================

Okay, folks. Now that we've learned some basic things abouts C++, it's time for a bit of a practice. Take a look at the tasks below.
The second task might require additional research from you.

### Task 1: Variables changer
Task: Write a program which asks the user to enter values for two variables of type integer. After that the program should swap their values.
Here is a little example what exactly should happen.

Input: 
```
	a = 21, b = 18
```
Output: 
```
	"The current value of a is 18"
	"The current value of b is 21"
```

### Task 2: Bitwise operators
Task: Play a bit with the bitwise operators. Try to calculate the results on hand before actually writing any code. (Take a look at the Two's complement)

##That's it! Now get to work!
