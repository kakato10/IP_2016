Materials
=====================

Hi there! Since you're here, my guess is that you want to take a look something new or just to make a recap of what we've talked about. In that case the links below should do the work.

* A [presentation](http://www.letu.edu/people/stevearmstrong/COSC%201303/NellDale%20Lectures/chapter%202.ppt), which can be considered as a summary of what you have learned already. It also contains information about other aspects of C++, that we're yet to talk about;

* http://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/ref/cpp_keywords.html - more info about reserved words and standard words (in the material they are called "predefined identifiers")

* [variables and variable types](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/);

* [memory usage of the primitive types of C++](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_types.htm);

* [Two's complement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6taPbsRqV4);

* [C++ bitwise operators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlvAojWf-eU);

That's for now. 
Wish you a pleasent reading!
