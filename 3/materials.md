Time to choose (booleans, if, if/else, switch) materials
=====================
So we've talked about boolean expressions. What are they, why do we use them and so on. Basically in these materials you can find again some more knowledge about them.
* [basic boolean expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VveLH3m6cfA)
* [compound boolean expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHNG4ODjrd8)

Boolean expressions are not that usable without the conditional statements. So there you go, some materials about them.
* [if and if/else statements](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson2.html)
* [switch statement](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k0t5wee3.aspx)

And of course something about C++ libraries. In that [list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) are mentioned a lot of them. Maybe the most useful once.
