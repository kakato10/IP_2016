Multidimensional arrays, dynamic memmory and pointers
=====================

Okay, dokey. Let's see how multidimensional arrays look like:

* [multidimensional array](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/65-multidimensional-arrays/), here you can learn a bit more about them;

* [static and dynamic memmory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-ht2AKyH4). This is a video explaining the basic concepts whith examples written in C. (It's also mentioned how it's done in C++);

* [detailed explaination](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/) of pointers, as well as their relations to arrays;
