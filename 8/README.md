Nested loops, multidimensional arrays and "strings"
=====================

##Task1: Basic matrix operations
Write a program which asks the user to enter two integers: "m" and "n". After that ask him to enter the elements of a matrix A with "m" rows and "n" columns.

The next step, for your program, is to transpose the matrix (matrix B). Now multitply the two matrices and display the sum of the elements located at the main anti-diagonal of the resulted matrix.

###Example
Input:
```
Rows: 4
Columns: 6
Matrix:  1 1 1 1 1 1
		 1 1 1 1 1 1
		 1 1 1 1 1 1
		 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
Output:
```
Transpose matrix:  1 1 1 1
				   1 1 1 1
		 		   1 1 1 1
		 		   1 1 1 1
		 		   1 1 1 1
		 		   1 1 1 1

Multiplied matrix: 6 6 6 6
				   6 6 6 6
				   6 6 6 6
				   6 6 6 6

Sum: 24
